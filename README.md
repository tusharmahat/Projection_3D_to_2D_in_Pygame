## Description

This Python project utilizes Pygame to create a 3D visualization of objects projected onto a 2D screen. It provides options to rotate the objects along different axes and toggle perspective projection.

## Installation and Setup

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tusharmahat/Projection_3D_to_2D_in_Pygame.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Projection_3D_to_2D_in_Pygame
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install pygame numpy
   ```
   This command will install the Pygame library for graphics and input handling, as well as the NumPy library for mathematical operations.

5. Run the project:
   ```
   python game.py
   ```

## Controls

- Use the mouse to interact with buttons and sliders.
- Click on the buttons to perform specific actions:
  - Quit: Close the application.
  - Reset: Reset the view to its initial state.
  - Perspective: Toggle perspective projection.
  - Rotate buttons: Rotate the object along the X, Y, and Z axes.
